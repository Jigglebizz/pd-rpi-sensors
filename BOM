2x DG406DJZ
1x MCP3202

_-=Components=-_

2x 1K-resistors
1x 150-Ohm resistor
1x 330-Ohm ressitor
1x 40x2 Female Header

Note:
R3 and R4 don't have to be 150/330 Ohms, respectively.
They are being used together as a voltage divider to bring
5V down to 3.3V for the Pi. You can use any two values for
these two, provided R4 is twice as much as R3.
